  "description": "Use this component to access a library of typical gradients useful throughout Ladybug. \nThe output from this component should be plugged into the colors_ input of the\n\"Legend Parameters\" component.\n-\nNote that the colorblind friendly schemes have prioritized readability for red-green\ncolorblindness (deuteranomaly, protanomaly, protanopia, and deuteranopia), which\nis by far more common than blue-yellow colorblindness. However, they are not\nnecessarily ideal for all types of color blindness, though they are monotonic\nand perceptually uniform to all forms of color vision. This means that they should\nbe readable as a dark-to-light scale by anyone.\n-\nFor an image of each of the gardients in the library, check here:\nhttps://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/blob/master/gradients.png\n-"
