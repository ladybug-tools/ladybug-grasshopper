  "description": "Adjust the assumptions of the passive strategies that can be overalid on the\nPsychrometric Chart using the \"LB PMV Polygon\" component. The default assumptions\nof each of the strategies are as follows: \n_\nThermal Mass + Night Vent - The polygon represents the conditions under which\nshaded, night-flushed thermal mass can keep occupants cool. By default, this\npolygon assumes that temperatures can get as high as 12 C above the max temperature\nof the comfort polygon as long temperatures 8 hours before the hot hour are\n3.0 C lower than the max temperture of the comfort polygon. This parameter\ncomponent can be used to adjust these two temperature values and the number of\nhours that the building keeps its \"coolth\".\n_\nOccupant Use of Fans - This polygon is made by assuming that an air speed of 1.0 m/s\nis the maximum speed tolerable before papers start blowing around and conditions\nbecome annoying to occupants. The polygon is determined by running a PMV model\nwith this fan air speed and the PMV inputs of the warmest comfort conditions.\nThis parameter component can be used to adjust this maximum acceptable air speed.\n_\nCapture Internal Heat - The polygon is made by assuming a minimum building balance\npoint of 12.8 C and any conditions that are warmer than that will keep occupants\ncomfortable (up to the comfort polygon). It is assumed that, above this building\nbalance temperature, the building is free-running and occupants are able to open\nwindows as they wish to keep conditions from overshooting the comfort polygon.\nNote that the default balance temperature of 12.8 C is fairly low and assumes a\nsignificant amount of internal heat from people, equipment. etc. Or the building \nas a well-insulated envelope to ensure what internal heat there is can leave the\nbuilding slowly. This parameter component can be used to adjust the balance\ntemperature.\n_\nPassive Solar Heating - The polygon represents the conditions under which\nsun-exposed thermal mass can keep occupants warm in winter. By default, this\npolygon assumes that temperatures can get as high as 12 C above the max temperature\nof the comfort polygon as long temperatures 8 hours before the hot hour are\n3.0 C lower than the max temperture of the comfort polygon. This parameter\ncomponent can be used to adjust these two temperature values and the number of\nhours that the building keeps its \"coolth\".\n-"
