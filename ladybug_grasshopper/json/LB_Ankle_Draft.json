  "description": "Calculate the percentage of people dissatisfied from cold drafts at ankle-level.\n_\nThe original tests used to create the model involved blowing cold air on\nsubject's ankles at a height of 10 cm off of the ground.\nThe formula was officially incorporated in the ASHRAE 55 standard in 2020\nwith a recommendation that PPD from ankle draft not exceed 20%.\n_\nFor more information on the methods used to create this model see the following:\nLiu, S., S.
