  "description": "Produce a DDY file with a heating and a cooling design day from an EPW.\n_\nThis method will first check if there is any heating or cooling design day information\ncontained within the EPW itself. If None is found, the heating and cooling design\ndays will be derived from analysis of the annual data within the EPW, which is\nusually less representative of the climate since only one year of data is used\nto derive the DDY (instead of the usual multi-year analysis that is performed for\nDDYs distributed with EPWs).\n_\nInformation on the uncertainty introduced by using only one year of data to create\ndesign days can be found in AHSRAE HOF 2013, Chapter 14.14.\n-"
