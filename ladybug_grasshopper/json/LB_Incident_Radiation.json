  "description": "Calculate the incident radiation on geometry using a sky matrix from the \"Cumulative\nSky Matrix\" component.\n_\nSuch studies of incident radiation can be used to apprxomiate the energy that can\nbe collected from photovoltaic or solar thermal systems. They are also useful\nfor evaluating the impact of a building's windows on both energy use and the\nsize/cost of cooling systems. For studies of cooling system size/cost, a sky\nmatrix derived from the STAT file's clear sky radiation should be used. For\nstudies of energy use impact, such as the evaluation of passive solar heating\nor the potential for excessive cooling energy use, a matrix from EPW radiation\nshould be used.\n_\nNote that NO REFLECTIONS OF SOLAR ENERGY ARE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS\nPERFORMED BY THIS COMPONENT and it is important to bear in mind that vertical\nsurfaces typically receive 20% - 30% of their solar energy from reflection off\nof the ground. Also note that this component uses the CAD environment's ray\nintersection methods, which can be fast for geometries with low complexity\nbut does not scale well for complex geometries or many test points. For such\ncomplex cases and situations where relfection of solar energy are important,\nhoneybee-radiance should be used.\n-"
