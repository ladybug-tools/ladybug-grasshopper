  "description": "Visualize the desirability of shade in terms of the time period of blocked\nsun vectors for each part of a shade geometry.\n_\nThe calculation assumes that all input _vectors represent sun to be blocked, which\nis often the case when evaluating shade in terms of its benefit for glare reduction\nand occupant visual comfort. It can also be the case when sun vectors have been\nfiltered to account for times of peak cooling demand or for the heat stress of\nhuman subjects.\n_\nThe component outputs a colored mesh of the shade illustrating the helpfulness of\nshading each part of the _shade_geo. A higher saturation of blue indicates that\nshading the cell blocks more hours of sun and is therefore more desirable.\n_\nThe units for shade desirability are hrs/square Rhino unit, which note the amount\nof time that sun is blocked by a given cell. So, if a given square meter of input\n_shade_geo has a shade desirability of 10 hrs/m2, this means that a shade in\nthis location blocks an average of 10 hours to each of the _study_points.\n-"
