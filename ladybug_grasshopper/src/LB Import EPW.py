Import climate data from a standard .epw file.

-

    Args:
        _epw_file: An .epw file path on your system as a string.
        
    Returns:
        location: A Ladybug Location object describing the location data in the
            weather file.
        dry_bulb_temperature: The houlry dry bulb temperature, in C.
            Note that this is a full numeric field (i.e. 23.6) and not an integer
            representation with tenths. Valid values range from 70 C to
            70 C. Missing value for this field is 99.9.
        dew_point_temperature: The hourly dew point temperature, in C.
            Note that this is a full numeric field (i.e. 23.6) and not an integer
            representation with tenths. Valid values range from 70 C to
            70 C. Missing value for this field is 99.9.
        relative_humidity: The hourly Relative Humidity in percent.
            Valid values range from 0% to 110%. Missing value for this field is 999.
        wind_speed: The hourly wind speed in m/sec.
            Values can range from 0 to 40. Missing value is 999.
        wind_direction: The hourly wind direction in degrees.
            The convention is that North=0.0, East=90.0, South=180.0, West=270.0.
            (If wind is calm for the given hour, the direction equals zero.)
            Values can range from 0 to 360. Missing value is 999.
        direct_normal_rad: The hourly Direct Normal Radiation in Wh/m2.
            (Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m2 received directly from the
            solar disk on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays, during
            the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) If the field
            is missing ( 9999) or invalid (<0), it is set to 0. Counts of such
            missing values are totaled and presented at the end of the runperiod.
        diffuse_horizontal_rad: The hourly Diffuse Horizontal Radiation in Wh/m2.
            (Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m2 received from the sky
            (excluding the solar disk) on a horizontal surface during the
            number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) If the field is
            missing ( 9999) or invalid (<0), it is set to 0. Counts of such
            missing values are totaled and presented at the end of the runperiod.
        global_horizontal_rad: The hourly Global Horizontal Radiation in Wh/m2.
            (Total amount of direct and diffuse solar radiation in Wh/m2
            received on a horizontal surface during the number of minutes
            preceding the time indicated.) It is not currently used in
            EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a minimum value of 0;
            missing value for this field is 9999.
        horizontal_infrared_rad: The Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity in Wh/m2.
            If it is missing, it is calculated from the Opaque Sky Cover field
            as shown in the following explanation. It should have a minimum
            value of 0; missing value for this field is 9999.
        direct_normal_ill: The hourly Direct Normal Illuminance in lux.
            (Average amount of illuminance in hundreds of lux received
            directly from the solar disk on a surface perpendicular to the
            sun's rays, during the number of minutes preceding the time
            indicated.) It is not currently used in EnergyPlus calculations.
            It should have a minimum value of 0; missing value for this field
            is 999999 and will be considered missing of >= 999900.
        diffuse_horizontal_ill: The hourly Diffuse Horizontal Illuminance in lux.
            (Average amount of illuminance in hundreds of lux received from
            the sky (excluding the solar disk) on a horizontal surface during
            the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) It is not
            currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a
            minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 999999 and
            will be considered missing of >= 999900.
        global_horizontal_ill: The hourly Global Horizontal Illuminance in lux.
            (Average total amount of direct and diffuse illuminance in
            hundreds of lux received on a horizontal surface during the
            number of minutes preceding the time indicated.) It is not
            currently used in EnergyPlus calculations. It should have a
            minimum value of 0; missing value for this field is 999999 and
            will be considered missing of >= 999900.
        total_sky_cover: The fraction for total sky cover (tenths of coverage).
            (i.e. 1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total coverage) (Amount of sky
            dome in tenths covered by clouds or obscuring phenomena at the
            hour indicated at the time indicated.) Minimum value is 0;
            maximum value is 10; missing value is 99."
        barometric_pressure: The hourly weather station pressure in Pa.
            Valid values range from 31,000 to 120,000...
            Missing value for this field is 999999."
        model_year: The year from which the hourly data has been extracted.
            EPW files are synthesized from real recorded data from different
            years in a given climate. This is done to ensure that, for each
            month, the selected data is statistically representative of the
            average monthly conditions over the 18+ years of recording the data.
            Different EPW files will be synthesized from different years
            depeding on whether they are TMY (Typical Meteorological Year),
            TMY2, TMY3, AMY (Actual Meteorological Year) or other.
