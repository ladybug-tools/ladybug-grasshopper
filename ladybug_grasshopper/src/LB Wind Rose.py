Create a plot of any hourly data by wind directions.
-

    Args:
        north_: An optional number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise
            difference between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees. 90 is West
            and 270 is East. This can also be Vector for the direction to North
            (Default: 0).
        _data: A HourlyContinuousCollection or HourlyDiscontinuousCollection of
            values corresponding to the wind directions, which is "binned" by
            the direction intervals. This input usually consists of wind speed
            values, but is not limited to this data type. It can also be a list
            of data collections in which case multiple wind roses will be output.
        _wind_direction: A HourlyContinuousCollection or HourlyDiscontinuousCollection
            of wind directions which will be used to "bin" the _data items for the
            windrose.
        _dir_count_: Number that determines the number of directions to the wind rose
            will display. The number of directions must be greater then three to plot
            the wind rose (Default: 36).
        _center_pt_: Point3D to be used as a starting point to generate the geometry of
            the plot (Default: (0, 0, 0)).
        _show_calmrose_: A boolean to indicate if the wind rose displays a calm rose. The
            calm rose is a radial plot in the center of the wind rose with a radius
            corresponding to the total zero values divided by the number of
            directions. This allows the wind rose to represent zero values
            from _data even though such values don't have any direction
            associated with them. (Default: False).
        _show_freq_: A boolean to show the frequency of _data data values in the
            wind direction bins. The frequency lines represent constant intervals
            in time while the color illustrates the average _data data values
            associated with each interval. The number of frequency lines with
            similar colors therefore indicate a higher frequency of that
            value. (Default: True)
        _freq_dist_: The distance for the frequency interval in model units. If 
            _show_calmrose is True, then the initial frequency interval corresponds
            to the number of calm hours in the data collection, which may not
            align with this _freq_dist (Default: 5 meters)
       _freq_hours_: The number of hours in each frequency interval (Default: 50).
        _max_freq_lines_: A number representing the maximum frequency intervals in
            the rose, which determines the maximum amount of hours represented by the
            outermost ring of the windrose. Specifically, this number multiplied by the
            _freq_hours_ parameter will equal the maximum hours in that outermost
            ring. By default, this value is determined by the wind direction with the
            largest number of hours (the highest frequency) but you may want to change
            this if you have several wind roses that you want to compare to each other.
            For example, if you have wind roses for different months or seasons, which
            each have different maximum frequencies.
        legend_par_: An optional LegendParameter object to change the display of the
            WindRose plot. The number of segments in the legend determines the number of
            frequency intervals in the wind rose. If nothing is provided, a default
            LegendParameter object is computed using values from the wind data with
            11 segments (Default: None).
        statement_: A conditional statement as a string (e.g. a > 25) for
            the _data and _wind_direction inputs.
            .
            The variable of the first collection input to _data should always
            be named 'a' (without quotations), the variable of the second list
            should be named 'b', and so on. The wind direction is always the
            last variable, though most statements won't have a need for it.
            .
            For example, if three data collections are connected to _data
            and the following statement is applied:
            '18 < a < 26 and b < 80 and c > 2'
            The resulting collections will only include values where the first
            data collection is between 18 and 26, the second collection is less
            than 80 and the third collection is greater than 2.
        period_: An optional Ladybug analysis period to be applied to all of
            the input data.

    Returns:
        report: ...
        mesh: A colored mesh representing the wind rose derived from the input data.
            Multiple meshes will be output for several data collections are input.
        compass: A set of circles, lines and text objects that mark the cardinal
            directions in relation to the wind rose.
        orient_line: Line geometries representing the edges (or "spokes") of the wind
            rose directions.
        freq_line: Polygon geometries representing the frequency intervals of the wind
            rose.
        windrose_line: Polygon geometries representing the windrose outlines. This
            output is hidden by default and should be connected to a native
            Grasshopper Geometry component in order to be visualized.
        legend: Geometry representing the legend for the wind rose.
        title: A text object for the global_title.
        prevailing: The predominant direction of the outpt wind rose in clockwise
            degrees from north. 0 is North, 90 is East, 180 is South, 270 is West.
        angles: A list of angles corresponding to each windrose directions.
        calm_hours: The number of hours with calm wind speeds. Only returns a value if the input 
            _data is wind speed. 
        histogram_data: The input _data in a histogram structure after it has gone through any of 
            the statement or period operations input to this component.
