"""
Output a Sunpath (aka. sun plot) graphic into the Rhino scene.
-
The component also outputs sun vectors that can be used for solar access
analysis and shading design.
-

    Args:
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise
            difference between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. This can also be Vector for the
            direction to North. (Default: 0)
        _location: A ladybug Location that has been output from the "LB Import EPW"
            component or the "LB Construct Location" component.
        hoys_: A number or list of numbers between 0 and 8760 that represent the
            hour of the year at which to evaluate the sun position. The
            "LB Calculate HOY" component can output this number given a month,
            day and hour. The "LB Analysis Period" component can output a
            list of HOYs within a certain hour or date range.
        dl_saving_: An optional analysis period for daylight saving time.
            If None, no daylight saving time will be used. (Default: None)
        solar_time_: A boolean to indicate if the input hours should be treated
             as solar time instead of standard or daylight time. (Default: False)
        _center_pt_: A point for the center of the sun path. (Default: (0, 0, 0))
        _scale_: A number to set the scale of the sun path. The default is 1,
            which corresponds to a radius of 100 meters in the current Rhino
            model's unit system.
        projection_: Optional text for the name of a projection to use from the sky
            dome hemisphere to the 2D plane. If None, a 3D sun path will be drawn
            instead of a 2D one. (Default: None) Choose from the following:
                * Orthographic
                * Stereographic
        daily_: Boolean to note whether the sunpath should display only one daily
            arc for each unique day in the input hoys_ (True) or whether the
            output sun path geometry should be for the entire year, complete
            with analemmas for all sun-up hours and a daily arc for each
            month (False). (Default: False)
        data_: Optional HourlyContinuousCollection objects, which will be used
            to generate colors that align with each of the sun_pts. This data
            can also be used along with the statement_ below to select out
            sun positions that meet certain conditions.
        statement_: A conditional statement as a string (e.g. a > 25).
            .   
            The variable of the first data collection should always be named 'a'
            (without quotations), the variable of the second list should be
            named 'b', and so on.
            .
            For example, if three data collections are connected to _data
            and the following statement is applied:
            '18 < a < 26 and b < 80 and c > 2'
            The resulting collections will only include values where the first
            data collection is between 18 and 26, the second collection is less
            than 80 and the third collection is greater than 2.
        legend_par_: An optional LegendParameter object to change the display
            of the data on the sun path. This can also be a list of legend
            parameters to be applied to the different connected data_.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        vectors: Vector(s) indicating the direction of sunlight for each sun
            position on the sun path. Note that these vectors point downwards
            towards the ground.
        altitudes: Number(s) indicating the sun altitude(s) in degrees for
            each sun position on the sun path.
        azimuths: Number(s) indicating the sun azimuths in degrees for each
            sun position on the sun path.
        hoys: The hour of the year for each sun positions on the sun path.
        sun_pts: Point(s) representing the location of the sun on the sunpath.
        analemma: A set of curves that mark the hourly positions of the sun
            throughout the different months of the year.
        daily: A set of arcs that mark the path of the sun across the sky
            dome over the course of a day.
        compass: A set of circles, lines and text objects that mark the cardinal
            directions in relation to the sun path.
        legend: Geometry representing the legend for the input data_. Will be None
            if no _data is connected.
        title: A text object for the title of the sunpath.
        color_pts: A list of points colored with the input data_, which will display
            in the Rhino scene in accordance with the legend. Note that
            the text representation of these objects bears the RGB color of each
            point. So casting this output to text and then to a color will
            yeild color objects that can be used for previewing other types
            of geometry with the input data_. Will be None if no _data is connected.
