"""
Genrate a mesh with corresponding test points from a Rhino Brep (or Mesh).
_
The resulting mesh will be in a format that the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component
will accept.
-

    Args:
        _geometry: Brep or Mesh from which to generate the points and grid.
        _grid_size: Number for the size of the test grid.
        _offset_dist_: Number for the distance to move points from the surfaces
            of the input _geometry.  Typically, this should be a small positive
            number to ensure points are not blocked by the mesh. Default is 0.
    
    Returns:
        points: Test points at the center of each mesh face.
        vectors: Vectors for the normal direction at each of the points.
        face_areas: Area of each mesh face.
        mesh: Analysis mesh that can be passed to the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component.
