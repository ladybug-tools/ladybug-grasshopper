"""
Create a set of parameters that define the acceptable conditions of the
Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal comfort model.
-
These parameters can be plugged into any of the components that compute
PMV thermal comfort.
-

    Args:
        _ppd_thresh_:  A number between 5 and 100 that represents the upper
                threshold of PPD that is considered acceptable.
                Default is 10, which charcterizes most buildings in the
                ASHRAE-55 and EN-15251 standards.
        _hr_upper_: A number between 0 and 1 indicating the upper limit of
            humidity ratio that is considered acceptable.
            Default is 1 for essentially no limit.
        _hr_lower_: A number between 0 and 1 indicating the lower limit of
            humidity ratio considered acceptable.
            Default is 0 for essentially no limit.
        _still_air_thresh_: The air speed threshold in m/s at which the standard
            effective temperature (SET) model will be used to correct for the
            cooling effect of elevated air speeds.
            Default is 0.1 m/s, which is the limit according to ASHRAE-55.
    
    Returns:
        pmv_par: A PMV comfort parameter object that can be plugged into
            any of the components that compute PMV thermal comfort.
