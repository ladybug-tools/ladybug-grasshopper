"""
Filter or select faces of geometry based on their orientation.

    Args:
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise difference between
            the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees. 90 is West and 270
            is East. This can also be Vector for the direction to North. (Default: 0)
        _geometry: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes which will be broken down into individual
            planar faces and filtered based on the direction they face.
        _orientation: Text for the direction that the geometry is facing. This can also be
            a number between 0 and 360 for the azimuth (clockwise horizontal
            degrees from North) that the geometry should face. Choose from
            the following:
            _
            * N = North
            * NE = Northeast
            * E = East
            * SE = Southeast
            * S = South
            * SW = Southwest
            * W = West
            * NW = Northwest
            * Up = Upwards
            * Down = Downwards
        _up_angle_: A number in degrees for the maximum declination angle from the positive
            Z Axis that is considerd up. This should be between 0 and 90 for
            the results to be practical. (Default: 30).
        _down_angle_: A number in degrees for the maximum angle difference from the newative
            Z Axis that is considerd down. This should be between 0 and 90 for
            the results to be practical. (Default: 30).
        _horiz_angle_: Angle in degrees for the horizontal deviation from _orientation
            that is still considered to face that orientation. This should be
            between 0 and 90 for the results to be practical. Note that this input
            has no effect when the input orientation is "Up" or "Down". (Default: 23).

    Returns:
        report: ...
        sel_geo: Selected faces of the input geometry that are facing the direction
            corresponding to the input criteria.
