"""
Create a set of parameters that define the characteristics of a human
in relation to the sun that falls on them.
-
These parameters can be plugged into any of the components that estimate
mean radiant temperature (MRT) deltas as a result of being in the sun.
-

    Args:
        _posture_: A text string indicating the posture of the body. Letters must
            be lowercase.  Choose from the following:
                - standing
                - seated
                - supine
            Default is "standing".
        _sharp_: A number between 0 and 180 representing the solar horizontal
            angle relative to front of person (SHARP). 0 signifies sun that is
            shining directly into the person's face and 180 signifies sun that
            is shining at the person's back. Default is 135, asuming that a person
            typically faces their side or back to the sun to avoid glare.
        _body_az_: A number between 0 and 360 representing the direction that
            the human is facing in degrees (0=North, 90=East, 180=South, 270=West).
            Default is None, which will assume that the sharp input dictates the
            degrees the human is facing from the sun.
        _absorptivity_: A number between 0 and 1 representing the average
            shortwave absorptivity of the body (including clothing and skin color).
            Typical clothing values - white: 0.2, khaki: 0.57, black: 0.88
            Typical skin values - white: 0.57, brown: 0.65, black: 0.84
            Default is 0.7 for average (brown) skin and medium clothing.
        _emissivity_: A number between 0 and 1 representing the average
            longwave emissivity of the body.  Default is 0.95, which is almost
            always the case except in rare situations of wearing metalic clothing.
    
    Returns:
        sol_body_par: A solar body parameter object that can be plugged into
            any of the components that estimate mean radiant temperature (MRT)
            deltas as a result of being in the sun.
