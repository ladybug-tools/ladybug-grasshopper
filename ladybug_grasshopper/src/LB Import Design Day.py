Import hourly climate data from a Ladybug DesignDay object.
-

    Args:
        _design_day: A DesignDay object to import.
    
    Returns:
        location: A Ladybug Location object describing the location of the
            design day.
        dry_bulb_temperature: The houlry dry bulb temperature over the design
            day, in C.
        dew_point_temperature: The hourly dew point temperature over the design
            day, in C.
        relative_humidity: The hourly Relative Humidity over the design day
            in percent.
        wind_speed: The hourly wind speed over the design day in m/sec.
        wind_direction: The hourly wind direction over the design day in degrees.
            The convention is that North=0.0, East=90.0, South=180.0, West=270.0.
        direct_normal_rad: The hourly Direct Normal Radiation over the design
            day in Wh/m2.
        diffuse_horizontal_rad: The hourly Diffuse Horizontal Radiation over
            the design day in Wh/m2.
        global_horizontal_rad: The hourly Global Horizontal Radiation over the
            design day in Wh/m2.
        horizontal_infrared_rad: The Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity
            over the design day in Wh/m2.
        total_sky_cover: The fraction for total sky cover over the design day
            in tenths of coverage.
        barometric_pressure: The hourly weather station pressure over the
            design day in Pa.
