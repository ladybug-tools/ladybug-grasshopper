"""
Bake a clored mesh into the Rhino scene as a group of colored hatches.
_
This is useful when exporting ladybug graphics from Rhino to vector-based programs
like Inkscape or Illustrator since hatches are exported from Rhino as colored-filled
polygons.
-

    Args:
        _mesh: A colored mesh (or list of colored meshes) to be baked into the Rhino
            scene as groups of colored hatches.
        layer_: Text for the layer name on which the hatch will be added. If unspecified,
            it will be baked onto the currently active layer.
        _run: Set to 'True' to bake the mesh into the scene as hatches.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings ...
