"""
Evaluate the percent view to the outdoors or sky from input geometry through context.
_
Such view calculations can be used to estimate the quality of a view to the
outdoors from a given location on the indoors. They can also be used on
the outdoors to evaluate the openness of street canyons to the sky, which has
implications for the pedestrian expereince as well as the rate of radiant heat
loss from urban surfaces and the sky at night.
_
Note that this component uses the CAD environment's ray intersection methods,
which can be fast for geometries with low complexity but does not scale well
for complex geometries or many test points. For such complex studies,
honeybee-radiance should be used.

    Args:
        _view_type: Text or an integer representing the type of view analysis
            to conduct.  Choose from the following options.
                _
                0 - HorizontalRadial - The percentage of the 360 horizontal view
                    plane that is not blocked by the context geometry.
                _
                1 - Horizonta30DegreeOffset - The percentage of the 360 horizontal
                    view band bounded on top and bottom by a 30 degree offset from
                    the horizontal plane. 30 degress corresponds roughly to the
                    vertical limit of human peripheral vision.
                _
                2 - Spherical - The percentage of the sphere surrounding each of
                    the test points that is not blocked by context geometry. This
                    is equivalent to a solid angle and gives equal weight to all
                    portions of the sphere.
                _
                3 - SkyExposure - The percentage of the sky that is visible from
                    each of the the test points. This is distinct from SkyView,
                    which is the amount of sky seen by a surface. SkyExposure is
                    equivalent to a solid angle and gives equal weight to all
                    portions of the sky.
                _
                4 - SkyView - The percentage of the sky that is visible from the
                    _geometry surfaces. This is distinct from SkyExposure, which
                    treats each part of the sky with equal weight. SkyView weights
                    the portions of the sky according to thier projection into
                    the plane of the surface being evaluated. So SkyView for a
                    horizontal surface would give more importance to the sky
                    patches that are overhead vs. those near the horizon.
        _resolution_: A positive integer for the number of times that the original
            view vectors are subdivided. 1 indicates that 145 evenly-spaced
            vectors are used to describe a hemisphere, 2 indicates that
            577 vectors describe a hemisphere, and each successive value will
            roughly quadruple the number of view vectors used. Setting this to
            a high value will result in a more accurate analysis but will take
            longer to run. (Default: 1).
        _geometry: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes for which view analysis
            will be conducted. If Breps are input, they will be subdivided using
            the _grid_size to yeild individual points at which analysis will
            occur. If a Mesh is input, view analysis analysis will be
            performed for each face of this mesh instead of subdividing it.
        context_: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes representing context geometry
            that can block view from the test _geometry.
        _grid_size: A positive number in Rhino model units for the size of grid
            cells at which the input _geometry will be subdivided for direct sun
            analysis. The smaller the grid size, the higher the resolution of
            the analysis and the longer the calculation will take.  So it is
            recommended that one start with a large value here and decrease
            the value as needed. However, the grid size should usually be
            smaller than the dimensions of the smallest piece of the _geometry
            and context_ in order to yield meaningful results.
        _offset_dist_: A number for the distance to move points from the surfaces
            of the input _geometry.  Typically, this should be a small positive
            number to ensure points are not blocked by the mesh. (Default: 10 cm
            in the equivalent Rhino Model units).
        _geo_block_: Set to "True" to count the input _geometry as opaque and
            set to "False" to discount the _geometry from the calculation and
            only look at context_ that blocks the view.  The default depends on
            the _view_type used.
            _
            It is "True" for:
            * SkyExposure
            * SkyView
            _
            It is "False" for:
            * HorizontalRadial
            * Horizonta30DegreeOffset
            * Spherical
        legend_par_: Optional legend parameters from the "LB Legend Parameters"
            that will be used to customize the display of the results.
        _cpu_count_: An integer to set the number of CPUs used in the execution of the
            intersection calculation. If unspecified, it will automatically default
            to one less than the number of CPUs currently available on the
            machine or 1 if only one processor is available.
        _run: Set to "True" to run the component and perform view analysis of
            the input _geometry.

    Returns:
        report: ...
        points: The grid of points on the test _geometry that are be used to perform
            the view analysis.
        view_vecs: A list of vectors which are projected from each of the points
            to evaluate view.
        results: A list of numbers that aligns with the points. Each number indicates
            the percentage of the view_vecs that are not blocked by context geometry.
        mesh: A colored mesh of the test _geometry representing the percentage of
            the input _geometry's view that is not blocked by context.
        legend: A legend showing the number of hours that correspond to the colors
            of the mesh.
        title: A text object for the study title.
        int_mtx: A Matrix object that can be connected to the "LB Deconstruct Matrix"
            component to obtain detailed vector-by-vector results of the study.
            Each sub-list (aka. branch of the Data Tree) represents one of the
            points used for analysis. The length of each sub-list matches the
            number of view_vecs used for the analysis. Each value in the sub-list
            is either a "1", indicating that the vector is visible for that
            vector, or a "0", indicating that the vector is not visible for
            that vector.
