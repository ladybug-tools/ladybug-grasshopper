"""
Visualize the desirability of shade in terms of proximity of conditions to
a favorable temerature range.
_
The calculation runs by generating solar vectors for a data collection of input
temperature values. Solar vectors for hours when the temperature is above the
upper temperature threshold contribute positively to shade desirability
while solar vectors for hours when the temperature is below the lower temperature
threshold contribute negatively.
_
The component outputs a colored mesh of the shade illustrating the net effect of
shading each mesh face. A higher saturation of blue indicates that shading the
cell is desirable. A higher saturation of red indicates that shading the cell is
harmful (blocking more helpful winter sun than harmful summer sun). Desaturated
cells indicate that shading the cell will have relatively little effect on
thermal comfort.
_
The units for shade desirability are degree-days, which are essentially the
amount of time in days that sun is blocked by a given cell multiplied by the
degrees above (or below) the temperature thresholds during that time. So, if
a given square meter of input _geometry has a shade desirability of 10 degree-days,
this means that a shade in this location provides 1 day of sun protection
from conditions 10 degrees Celsius warmer than the _up_threshold_ to 1 square
meter of _study_region.

    Args:
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise
            difference between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. This can also be Vector for the
            direction to North. (Default: 0)
        _location: A ladybug Location that has been output from the "LB Import EPW"
            component or the "LB Construct Location" component.
        _temperature: An hourly data collection with the unshaded temperature experienced
            at the _study_region. This temperature will be used to evaluate shade
            benefit for this study region. This temperature data collection should
            typically be informed by an analysis with the "LB Outdoor Solar MRT"
            or the "LB Indoor Solar MRT" component, which will account for the
            increased temperature delta expereinced as a result of being in the
            sun. For evaluation of shade in terms of outdoor thermal comfort, the
            best practice is to use the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)
            temperature at the study region for this input. For evaluation of
            shade benefit in terms of indoor comfort,  the best practice is to
            use the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) derived from the
            "LB PMV Comfort" component for this input. In both cases, the MRT
            inputs to the thermal comfort models should use solar-adjusted MRT.
        _study_region: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes representing an area for which shading
            desirability is being evaluated. This is often the region where a human
            subject will sit (eg. a bench) or it could be the window of a building
            where an occupant might be standing or sitting.
        _geometry: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes representing shading to be evaluated in terms
            of its benefit. Note that, in the case that multiple shading geometries are
            connected, this component does not account for the interaction
            between the different shading surfaces.
        context_: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes representing context geometry that can
            block sunlight to the _study_region, therefore discounting any benefit
            or harm that could come to the region.
        _grid_size: A positive number in Rhino model units for the size of grid cells at
            which the input _geometry will be subdivided for shade benefit
            analysis. The smaller the grid size, the higher the resolution of
            the analysis and the longer the calculation will take.  So it is
            recommended that one start with a large value here and decrease
            the value as needed. However, the grid size should usually be
            smaller than the dimensions of the smallest piece of the _geometry
            and context_ in order to yield meaningful results.
        _up_threshold_: A number representing the temperature in Celsius above which
            shade is considered desirable/helpful. The default is 26C, which
            corresponds to the upper limit of "No Thermal Stress" according
            to the UTCI thermal comfort model (above this, heat stress begins).
            A different value may be desirable for indoor thermal comfort studies.
        _low_threshold_: A number representing the temperature in Celsius below which shade
            is considered harmful and access to the sun is preferable. The default
            is 9C, which corresponds to the lower limit of "No Thermal Stress"
            according to the UTCI thermal comfort model (below this, cold stress
            begins). A different value may be desirable for indoor thermal
            comfort studies.
        _timestep_: An integer for the number of timesteps per hour at which
            sun vectors will be generated for the analysis. Higher value will
            result in the generation of more vectors, which will make the result
            mesh smoother and more accurate. However, the calculation will take
            longer as there are more intersection operations to perform. The
            default is 1 timestep per hour, which is the coarsest resolution
            avalable and the fastest calculation.
        legend_par_: Optional legend parameters from the "LB Legend Parameters"
            that will be used to customize the display of the results.
        _cpu_count_: An integer to set the number of CPUs used in the execution of the
            intersection calculation. If unspecified, it will automatically default
            to one less than the number of CPUs currently available on the
            machine or 1 if only one processor is available.
        _run: Set to "True" to run the component and perform shade benefit analysis.

    Returns:
        report: ...
        vectors: The sun vectors that were used to evaluate the shade (note that
            these will increase as the _timestep_ increases).
        points: Points across the study region from which sun vectors will be projected.
        mesh: A colored mesh of the _geometry showing where shading is helpful (in blue),
            harmful (in red), or does not make much of a difference (white or
            desaturated colors). Note that the colors can change depending upon
            the input legend_par_.
        legend: Legend showing the numeric values of degree-days that correspond to
            the colors in the shade mesh.
        shade_help: The cumulative degree-days helped by shading the given cell. If a given
            square meter of _geometry has a shade helpfulness of 10 degree-days,
            this means that a shade in this location provides roughly 1 day of
            sun protection from conditions 10 degrees Celsius warmer than the
            _up_threshold_ to 1 square meter of _study_region.
        shade_harm: The cumulative degree-days harmed by shading the given cell. If a given
            square meter of _testShade has a shade harmfulness of -10 degree-days,
            this means that a shade in this location blocks roughly 1 day of sun
            duirng conditions that are 10 degrees Celsius colder than the
            _low_threshold_ to 1 square meter of _study_region.
        shade_net: The sum of the helpfulness and harmfulness for each cell. This will be
            negative if shading the cell has a net harmful effect and positive
            if the shade has a net helpful effect.
