"""
Set the sun in the Rhino scene to correspond to a given location and date/time.
_
This can be help coordinate Rhino visualizations with Ladybug analyses.
-

    Args:
        _location: A ladybug Location that has been output from the "LB Import EPW"
            component or the "LB Construct Location" component.
        hoys_: A number between 0 and 8760 that represents the hour of the year at
            which to set the sun position. The "LB Calculate HOY" component
            can output this number given a month, day and hour. The "LB
            Analysis Period" component can output a list of HOYs within a
            certain hour or date range.
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise
            difference between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. This can also be Vector for the
            direction to North. (Default: 0)
        _run: Set to True to run the component set the Rhino Sun.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
