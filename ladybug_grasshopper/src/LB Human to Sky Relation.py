"""
Calculate parameters for the relationship between human geometry and the sky given
the position of a human subject and context geometry surrounding this position.
_
The outputs of this component can be plugged into either the "LB Outdoor Solar MRT"
or the "LB Indoor Solar MRT" in order to account for context shading around a
human subject in these MRT calculations.
-

    Args:
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise
            difference between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. This can also be Vector for the
            direction to North. (Default: 0)
        _location: A ladybug Location that has been output from the "LB Import EPW"
            component, the "LB Import Location" component, or the "LB Construct
            Location" component. This will be used to compute hourly sun
            positions for the fract_body_exp.
        _position: A point for the position of the human subject in the Rhino scene.
            This is used to understand where a person is in relationship to the
            _context. The point input here should be at the feet of the human
            a series of points will be generated above. This can also be a list
            of points, which will result in several outputs.
        _context: Rhino Breps and/or Rhino Meshes representing context geometry
            that can block the human subject's direct sun and view to the sky.
        _pt_count_: A positive integer for the number of points used to represent
            the human subject geometry. Points are evenly distributed over the
            _height_ and are used to compute fracitonal values for the
            fract_body_exp in the case that only some of the points can see the
            sun. When context shade around the subject is large or coarse,
            using a single point is likely to return similar results as using
            several points. However, this number should be increased when
            context is detailed and has the potential to shade only part of
            the human subject at a given time. (Default: 1).
        _height_: A number for the the height of the human subject in the current Rhino
            Model units. (Default: 1.8 m in the equivalent Rhino Model units;
            roughly the average height of a standing adult).
        _cpu_count_: An integer to set the number of CPUs used in the execution of the
            intersection calculation. If unspecified, it will automatically default
            to one less than the number of CPUs currently available on the
            machine or 1 if only one processor is available.
        _run: Set to "True" to run the component and compute the human/sky relationship.
            If set to "False" but all other required inputs are specified, this
            component will output points showing the human subject.

    Returns:
        report: ...
        human_points: The points used to represent the human subject in the calculation
            of the fraction of the body exposed to sun. Note that these are
            generated even when _run is set to "False".
        human_line: Line representing the height of the human subject. Note that this
            is generated even when _run is set to "False".
        fract_body_exp: A data collection for the fraction of the body exposed to
            direct sunlight at each hour of the year. This can be plugged into
            the "Solar MRT" components in order to account for context shading
            in the computation of MRT.
        sky_exposure: A single number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the sky
            vault in human subjectâ€™s view. This can be plugged into the
            "Solar MRT" components in order to account for context shading
            in the computation of MRT.
